    â”‚ The error message "command not found" indicates that the      â”‚
    â”‚ system could not locate a command with the name "hfghfxh".    â”‚
    â”‚ This is likely because "hfghfxh" is not a valid terminal      â”‚
    â”‚ command. The user might have misspelled or mistyped the       â”‚
    â”‚ command.                                                      â”‚

    â”‚ To fix this error, the user should check the spelling and try â”‚
    â”‚ entering a valid command. For example, if the user intended   â”‚
    â”‚ to list the files in the current directory, the correct       â”‚
    â”‚ command would be "ls".                                        â”‚
